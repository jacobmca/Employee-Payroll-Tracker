# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description

This is my completed repository for the UC Berkeley eDX Bootcamp's challenge for Week 3: JavaScript. I completed this challenge to display my understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript; it specifically displays usage of variables, loops, arrays, functions, and a number of other common JavaScript concepts.

This repository takes the original, unsolved code provided for this week's unit and updates it to include a working collectEmployees function that allows a user to add employees to the page's chart. This updated code also includes completed displayAverageSalary and getRandomEmployee functions, which will calculate average employee salary and select a randomly employee respectively.

Completing this project has helped me display and reinforce my knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts in a project with discernable utility.
